## StableDiffusion_from_Scratch
Stable Diffusion Model from Scratch (PyTorch Implementation)

# Overview

This project is a complete PyTorch implementation of a Stable Diffusion model, built entirely from scratch by following an excellent educational resource. The project captures the full text-to-image and image-to-image generation pipeline, providing a deep dive into the core concepts and architectures that power modern generative models.

# Key Components

Variational Autoencoder (VAE): Encodes and decodes image data into a latent space, enabling efficient and meaningful representations of visual data.

U-Net Architecture: A powerful denoising model that learns to gradually transform noisy latent representations into coherent and high-quality images.

Text Encoder: Conditions the image generation on text prompts, allowing the model to align visual outputs with descriptive language inputs.

Diffusion Process: Implements the forward and reverse diffusion steps, systematically adding and removing noise to train the model for generating realistic and diverse outputs.

# Features

Text-to-Image Generation: Generate detailed and high-quality images from natural language prompts.

Image-to-Image Translation: Transform existing images by conditioning on textual descriptions for style transfer and content generation.

Modular PyTorch Code: Easy-to-read and well-structured codebase, ensuring clarity and extensibility.

Complete Training Pipeline: End-to-end training process, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
